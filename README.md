# Vectrex-Genesis-Controller-Adapter
A PSOC Based Genesis Controller to Vectrex Adapter

This is a PSOC 5LP based Genesis controller to Vectrex adapter that's only been built and tested as a prototype.
The schematic, if you can call it that, is based around a [Smartboard PSOC 5LP Development board](https://schmartboard.com/schmartboard-psoc-5lp-development-board-with-boot-loaded-psoc-5lp-ic-710-0008-05/).
Digital to analog conversion is done through a couple of Analog AD5290 chips.
